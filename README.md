# BB-8 Illustration
Going further with my front-end developement skills, I challenge myself to do something that I've never done before. Making a
CSS Illustration. I chose to make one of the Grahic design of `Justas Galaburda` - [the BB-8](https://dribbble.com/shots/2408834-BB-8) 
which is a great start. You can view my awesome project here on this link - **[The BB-8 Illustration](http://denniscual.github.io/bb-illustration)**.
